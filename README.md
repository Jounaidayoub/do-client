## Features

- HTTP tunneling
- Zero firewall or port-forwarding setup
- Single-command startup with `npx dotunnel`
- Runs on Cloudflare Edge network for low latency (‚ö° Blazingly fast!)

## Quick Start

### Run without installation

```bash
npx dotunnel
```

By default, this will:

1. Prompt you for your local port (e.g.: 3000)
2. Ask for a name for your proxy (e.g.: `my-app`)
3. Output a public URL (e.g. `https://my-app-prxy.ayooub.me`)
4. ‚úÖ Forward requests from the public URL to your local server

### Example Usage

When you run `npx dotunnel`, you‚Äôll see:

```bash
$ npx dotunnel


? Enter the local port of the service to expose (e.g., 8000): 3000
? Enter a name for the proxy (e.g., todo): todo-api


üåê Forwarding to: http://localhost:3000
üîó Public URL:    https://todo-api-prxy.ayooub.me
```

Currently, all options are configured via an interactive prompt. Flags (e.g. `-p`, `--port`) will be supported Soon !!.

### Install globally

```bash
npm install -g dotunnel
dotunnel
```

Use the `-g` or `--global` flag to install once and run via `dotunnel` instead of `npx`.
